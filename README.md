<a href="https://grammarchecker.io/">Grammar Check</a> text with GrammarChecker.io
Grammar checkers are a type of foreign language writing aid that non-native speakers can use to proofread their writings, as these programmes attempt to detect syntactical errors.

Grammar checking is viewed as a specific implementation of a text iteration and markup process; other iteration/markup processes, such as spell checking and smart tagging, can essentially operate in the same manner (though currently they are not implemented like this). If grammar checking is mentioned in the subsequent documentation, this should be interpreted as a placeholder for the broader task of text markup. As the objects executing the text iteration are aware of the specific markup process for which they are used, it is possible to fine-tune the iteration to meet the requirements of that process.

# Objectives:
- While the user is editing his documents, grammatical errors should be checked automatically in the background. Errors should be flagged so that users are aware of their presence. The visible portion of a document should be given priority.
- When the user clicks on a text segment that has been marked for containing a grammar error, she should be provided with information and suggestions on how to correct or discard the mark up.
- The user wants to see the information and suggestions returned by the grammar checker immediately, so instead of marking the text, the process presents the result in a dialogue and asks the user how to continue.
